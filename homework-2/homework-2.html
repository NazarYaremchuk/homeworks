<h1>Human mission to Mars</h1>

    <div>
     <p>A human mission to Mars has been the subject of science fiction since the 1880s, and of aerospace engineering and scientific proposals <b>since the late 1940s</b>. Plans include landing on Mars for exploration at a minimum, with some considering exploring its moons Phobos and Deimos. Longterm proposals have included sending settlers and starting terraforming of the planet.</p>

<h2>Exploration of Mars</h2>
<div>
    <p>The exploration of Mars has been a goal of national space programs for decades. Conceptual work for missions that would involve human explorers has been ongoing since <span>the 1950s</span>, with planned missions typically being stated as taking place anywhere between 10 and 30 years from the time they are drafted.The list of <b>crewed</b> Mars mission plans shows the various mission proposals that have been put forth by <strong>multiple organizations</strong> and space agencies in this field of space exploration. Plans have varied from scientific expeditions, in which a small group (between two and eight astronauts) would visit Mars for a period of a few weeks or year, to a continuous presence (e.g. through research stations, colonization or other continuous humanization).[citation needed] Virtual visits to Mars, using haptic technologies, have also been proposed.[
        <br>
<i>In the 2010s</i>, numerous US, European, and Asian agencies were developing proposals for human missions to Mars.[citation needed] In fiction, Mars is a frequent target of exploration and settlement in books, graphic novels, and films.</p>
